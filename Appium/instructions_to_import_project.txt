Important Note: If you are using a different Java JDK version than the one used in the project, you may get below error. This is expected since the project is configured to use a different Java version than yours.

Error: 
IntelliJ: Cannot run program "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin\java.exe"
Eclipse: The project cannot be built until build path errors are resolved

To resolve this error, follow below steps.

IntelliJ IDE:
==========
1. Open pom.xml and update below properties to your Java version (that is currently configured as your JAVA_HOME path). Just mention the major version. For e.g. for Java 15.0.2, mention 15.
        <maven.compiler.source>15</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>15</maven.compiler.target>

2. Select your project root folder. Then go to File -> Project Structure.
Under Project settings, select "Project" tab.
For "Project SDK", select your Java JDK that is currently configured as your JAVA_HOME path.
For "Project language level", you can select the language level as per your Java JDK version. For e.g. if the Java JDK version is 15, then you can select "15 - Text blocks"
Build the project and you should be good.
